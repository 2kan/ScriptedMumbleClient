# Scripted Mumble Client

A headless client for Mumble/Murmur using the <not yet decided> scripting language.
This project is totally WIP and doesn't even work yet.


## Todo List

Short term:
* Get it communicating with Murmur.
* Simple commands (time, 1d20, basic eggdrop crap)

Long term:
* Find a suitable scripting language (preferably one that doesn't suck, which will be hard.)
* Audio streaming.
* Configuration (which could be done using scripts.)
