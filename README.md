# Scripted Mumble Client

A headless client for Mumble/Murmur using the &lt;to be decided&gt; scripting language.
This project is totally WIP and doesn't even work yet.


## Todo List

Short term:
* Get all the required libraries in.
* Make it do more than print "hi".
* Choose a license (there's nothing there to license yet)
* Get it communicating with Murmur.
* Simple commands. (time, 1d20, basic eggdrop crap)

Long term:
* Make sure it works on Linux.
* Find a suitable scripting language (preferably one that doesn't suck, which will be hard)
* Configuration (which could be done using scripts.)
* A proper build system (lots to choose from. CMake, SCons, premake, and so on)
* Audio streaming.
